Implement a binary tree using an array, vector or linked list. 
(Note: duplicates are allowed in a binary tree)

Store the following elements using the properties of a binary 
search tree.

25, 59, 288, 19, 13, 888, 109, 55, 118, 89, 33, 1001, 18, 44, 88, 
12, 24, 49, 9, 

Perform the in-order, post-order, pre-order, breadth-first 
traversals.

In addition to the traversals, print out the binary tree by 
level. Show the parent-child relationship for all the nodes of 
the tree.
